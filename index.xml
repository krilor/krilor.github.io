      <description>Related to my recent interest in CTF, I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a little time to implement a simple Ceasar cipher in Vue.js. It allows the user to replace letters with another letter some adjustable number of positions up or down the alphabet.
I did this partly because it&amp;rsquo;s a long time since I&amp;rsquo;ve done any Vue-related work and also because I find other online Ceasar cipher sites to be a bit clunky and not as user friendly.</description>

      <description>&amp;hellip; and it felt good!
This week I spent a couple of hours finding my way through Norwegian Police Security Services new job application which required &amp;ldquo;hacking&amp;rdquo; to apply. See the solution on Reddit, GitHub and Kode24. I had a lot of fun trying to figure out the puzzles and it got me excited about learning more.
While I liked the challenge, I do tend to like to learn in a more structured way.</description>

      <title>A simple RDBMS queue pattern</title>

      <description>I recently attended a MeetUp with Axel Fontaine where he briefly threw out an example of how to create a queue in an relational database. In this post I have a closer look at that idea and test it out in PostgreSQL.
So this is the gist of the idea. A consumer would consume messages while placing locks on the rows being processed, leveraging the ACID properties of the database.</description>

      <title>Drawing diagrams for use with Hugo - what software to choose?</title>

      <description>Now that I have a blog going the first thing I am pretty certain that I&amp;rsquo;ll need is some tool or software to draw diagrams with. More often than not, when discussing or writing about software, a diagram just helps with explaining what is going on.
In this post I explore my options and explain how I set up my tool(s) of choice.
The candidates I quick round of good ol&amp;rsquo; googling gave me the following options.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about starting a personal blog around software and the like. I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been hanging around in the golang subreddit, and came across Hugo - a super-fast static site generator written in go.
This is the start of my blog!
Resources used for setting up the blog
 Hugo - Host on GitHub Creating a Hugo site on GitHub Pages by Dillon Gavlock GitHub Pages Basics  I&amp;rsquo;m currently using the awesome hugo-coder theme.</description>
