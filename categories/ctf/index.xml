      <description>Related to my recent interest in CTF, I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a little time to implement a simple Ceasar cipher in Vue.js. It allows the user to replace letters with another letter some adjustable number of positions up or down the alphabet.
I did this partly because it&amp;rsquo;s a long time since I&amp;rsquo;ve done any Vue-related work and also because I find other online Ceasar cipher sites to be a bit clunky and not as user friendly.</description>

      <description>&amp;hellip; and it felt good!
This week I spent a couple of hours finding my way through Norwegian Police Security Services new job application which required &amp;ldquo;hacking&amp;rdquo; to apply. See the solution on Reddit, GitHub and Kode24. I had a lot of fun trying to figure out the puzzles and it got me excited about learning more.
While I liked the challenge, I do tend to like to learn in a more structured way.</description>
